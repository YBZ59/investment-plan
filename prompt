The system is for investment house in Israel, the final outcome of the system would be an ETF document that was generated based on : a template, that contains text and numeric values, the values are fetched from a spreadsheet (data sheet) that contains the values, some of them are constant (maintained manually) some values are being calculated based on some regulation documents that has the rules and formulas.The materials we have in hand now are a single template for ETF's, few regulation documents and the data sheet. the regulation documents dictate both some syntax and phrasing, and calculation (based on formula) of some fields in the Spreadsheet.  we were thinking as first phase/drop to only rely on the regulation for formula purposes, and sticking with the spreadsheet to serve as reference for the values in the template, in order to not have to map each field in the template, we wanted to inject both a final report example (the one we have) and the spreadsheet and the regulation docs, together you can reverse engineer from the final document the mapping. I will upload those later this week, for now let me explain the flow so you can create a UI Journey so we can show as a start (additional tab in the canvas), so this is the flow, a user logs into the system, the user can create a template and duplicate from an existing one, system can store many templates each has its' own mapping (to the spreadsheet and the regulation), the system main goal is to map the fields , and generate the final PDF document, the system allows to validate the PDF by auditors. the system also enable viewing all submitted reports, load previous report and compare and shows the differences.there will be set of 50 templates in the system, so user can choose which one he wants to use for generating the report.the thing is, that the user can always create a new report, but he needs to be based on a template, the system can allow uploading new templates so we have 50+1, but once done, the system needs to reverse engineer again the template to map the fields.
